# gulp-wp-theme documentation

You can grab gulp-wp-theme via npm or download the zip and build your project from scratch, based on gulp-wp-theme.

Per default, the gulp-wp-theme grabs your files from a `src` folder and compiles it to the `dist/wp-content/themes` folder, where it will be stored in a folder taking the name from your package.json.

But you can configure it all yourself. See following sections:

* [API documentation](https://github.com/whatwedo/gulp-wp-theme/blob/develop/docs/API.md) - Learn how you configure the tasks
